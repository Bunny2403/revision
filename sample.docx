This is the use of git branch command:

we used -"git branch" to check the branches

we used - "git checkout -b new_branch_name " to create a new branch and change the branch to it

we used -"git checkout master_branch_name" to change between branches

we will use git merge branch_name to merge the new breanch into the repo
